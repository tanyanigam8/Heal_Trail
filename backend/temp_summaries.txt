In this case, it appears that a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was not detected despite the patient having several different examinations by various physicians. The vast majority of infrarenal aneurysms are asymptomatic, and given the size of the aneurysm found (8.3 cm), it is unlikely to have grown to this magnitude in a short period of time.

Had the abdominal aorta been imaged in its entirety when the 4.9 cm aortic aneurysm was discovered at the level of the diaphragm along with celiac artery involvement, it is highly probable that the outcome would have been much more favorable. The radiologist reading and/or performing the pulmonary artery CT scan should have continued imaging the rest of the aorta at that juncture.

The Board's allegation of "failure to evaluate a patient with syncope and thoracic aneurysm for abdominal aortic aneurysm" has merit, and the care this patient received on this point fell below the standard of care.

In this case, the patient, Ms., was not completely worked up to exclude an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The vast majority of infrarenal aneurysms are asymptomatic, and given the patient's significant ectasia and calcification of the aortic wall, the entire intraabdominal aorta should have been imaged. Had this been done, the large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm would have been discovered, and the patient would have undergone the appropriate procedure with a markedly reduced risk. In other words, she would not have been discharged from the hospital because an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that large is an urgent, bordering on emergent indication for repair. The care this patient received fell below the standard of care.
